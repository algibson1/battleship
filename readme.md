### Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.

We planned what we expected and then made a pseudocode line graph to guide us as to the next step to take. Artemy had an excel spreadsheet where they made a tree of if statements and ideas as to how to approach the project. They also went through RubyDocs researching methods that would accomplish the expected outputs. Decided what class(es) to use to encompass the functionality that we were looking for. 

### If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?

We would work on our computer generating placements method, because when we attempted to give it a custom larger board size, it took a very....VERY long time to load. 

We would also go back into the user coordinate input method to allow for the acceptance of UPCASE or downcase coorindates, because it currently only accepts UPCASE.

### Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.

Mostly synchronous driver/navigator style, with some async for refactoring. 

### Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.

Mostly live and some comments via github.
